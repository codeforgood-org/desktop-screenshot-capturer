## main.py.old

The original `main.py` file that contained a simple to-do list manager. This file was replaced during the repository reorganization to transform the project into a proper desktop screenshot capturer application.

**Original Purpose:** Command-line to-do list manager
**Replaced:** 2024-01-XX
**Reason:** Repository name (`desktop-screenshot-capturer`) didn't match the actual functionality
